Title - Password Generator - Security Tool Implementation

About this Problem: This is a password generator program I made for creating strong passwords and also strengthening weak ones. The main idea is you can either generate a completely random strong password or take your easy password and make it stronger.
I used Python and made it with functions instead of classes because it seemed simpler to me.

Code Architecture:
1. generate_password function - takes password length as input. Makes sure atleast one uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character is there. Then fills rest with random characters. Finally shuffles everything.
2. strengthen_password function - takes a weak password from user. Checks what types of characters are missing (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special). Adds missing ones randomly and shuffles.
3. check_strength function - takes any password and checks if its strong or weak. Checks length is atleast 8 and has all 4 character types.
4. main function - shows menu with 4 options. Lets user pick what they want to do.

NOTE : When you run this program: It shows a menu. Option 1 asks for password length and generates random strong password. Option 2 asks for your weak password and makes it stronger. Option 3 checks if password is strong or weak. Option 4 exits program.

How it works:
1. Generating Password - first I check if length is atleast 4 (because we need atleast 1 of each type). Then I make 4 lists for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. I pick one random character from each list and add to password. Then I calculate how many more characters are needed (length minus 4). I use a while loop to add that many random characters from all combined characters. At end I shuffle the whole password list so the required characters arent at start.
2. Strengthening Password - I go through the users password character by character using a while loop. For each character I check if its uppercase, lowercase, digit, or special symbol using flags (has_uppercase=0 means no, has_uppercase=1 means yes). After checking all characters, if any flag is still 0, I add a random character of that missing type. Then shuffle everything and return it.
3. Checking Strength - first check if length is less than 8, if yes return Weak. Then go through each character with a while loop and set flags for what types are found. At end if all 4 flags are 1, return Strong, otherwise return Weak.

Pseudocode:

1. Program starts and prints Password Generator System title with some equal signs below it.
2. Set program_running flag to 1 and start while loop that runs while flag is 1.
3. Print menu with 4 options.
4. Take user input for choice.
5. If choice is 1 then ask for password length. Try to convert it to integer. If it fails set input_valid to 0 and print error. If it works call generate_password function with that length. If password is not None then print the generated password.
6. If choice is 2 then ask user to enter their easy password. Call strengthen_password function with it. If result is not None print both original and strengthened password.
7. If choice is 3 then ask for password. Call check_strength function and print whether its Strong or Weak.
8. If choice is 4 then print Exiting message and set program_running to 0 which will exit the loop.
9. If choice is anything else print invalid choice message.
10. Loop continues until user picks option 4.

Why I uses this format:
1. I used while loops with manual counting (count=count+1) instead of for loops because I find it easier to understand whats happening with the counter.
2. I used flags like has_uppercase=0 and has_uppercase=1 instead of True/False because 0 and 1 are simpler for me to work with.
3. String concatenation with + instead of f-strings because I kept forgetting the f-string format.
4. I check if result is not None instead of using if result: because it feels more explicit to me.
5. Used descriptive variable names like password_to_check, user_password, uppercase_letters so I dont forget what they are.
6. Manual string building with while loops instead of join() because I understand loops better than built-in functions.

Summary:
The program works for generating passwords and strengthening weak ones. Its pretty straightforward with a menu system. About 150 lines of code, uses 4 functions, handles basic errors.
